### How to Start

For the server, start with going to the `server/` directory and install all of the associated npm packages. Then, run the server using either of the following commands:

```bash
node server.js    # This will run the server once
nodemon server.js # This will allow hot-reloading of the server (restart on save)
```

Then, you can test API calls to the server (more info on testing and etc. can be found [here](server/TESTING.md))
